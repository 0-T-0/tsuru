Main new features
=================

    * Now tsuru has three types of pool: by team, public and default.
      Team's pool are segregated by teams, and cloud administrator should set
      teams in this pool manually. This pool are just accessible by team's
      members.

      Public pools are accessible by any user. It can be used to segregate
      machines that have specific hardware, like SSD hard drives or high end
      CPUs.

      Default pool are for experimentation and low profile apps,
      like service dashboard and "in development" apps.
      This is the old fallback pool, but with a explict flag.


Bug fixes
=========


Other improvements
==================

* Now tsuru don't try to start stopped/errored containers when containers move. `#1186
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1186>`_

Backward incompatible changes (action needed)
=============================================

    * You should change your fallback pool to default pool and to do that you
      can run a `tsuru pool-update pool_name --default=true`

    * tsr has been renamed to tsurud. Please update any procedures and
      workflows (including upstart and other init scripts).
