tsurud 0.13.0 release notes
===========================

Welcome to tsurud 0.13.0!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, `bug fixes`_, `general
improvements`_ and `backward incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of
when upgrading from tsurud 0.12.x or older versions.

.. _`new features`: `Main new features`_
.. _`general improvements`: `Other improvements`_
.. _`backward incompatible changes`: `Backward incompatible changes (action needed)`_

Main new features
=================

* New IaaS: tsuru now supports DigitalOcean, along with Amazon EC2 and
  CloudStack. Admins are able to spawn droplets on DigitalOcean and use them as
  managed nodes with tsuru. See :ref:`IaaS configuration <iaas_configuration>`
  for instructions on how to configure DigitalOcean integration (thanks Hugo
  Seixas Antunes).

Bug fixes
=========

* Fix OAuth authentication: the library used by tsuru used to blindly trust the
  token_type returned by the OAuth provider, but some providers provide
  mismatching types in the authorization request and the token. See
  `<https://github.com/golang/oauth2/issues/113>`_ for more details.

Other improvements
==================

Backward incompatible changes (action needed)
=============================================
