tsurud 0.12.1 release notes
===========================

Welcome to tsurud 0.12.1!

tsurud 0.12.1 includes `bug fixes`_ and `improvements`_ in the management of the
`tsuru host agent (bs) <https://github.com/tsuru/bs>`_.

.. _`improvements`: `General improvements`_

General improvements
====================

* Improve node registering process: now, when the creation of the bs container
  fails, we do not destroy managed hosts, but rather mark them as "waiting".
  tsuru already ensures that bs is running in the node before executing other
  operations.

* Use "ready" as the status of nodes running bs. In case everything goes fine
  during node creation/registration, tsuru will now mark the node as "ready"
  instead of "waiting".

Bug fixes
=========

* Fix race condition between bs status reporting and the deployment process,
  preventing bs from destroying containers that are still being deployed.
