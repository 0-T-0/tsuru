tsurud 1.0.0 release notes
==========================

Welcome to tsurud 1.0.0!

These release notes cover the `new features`, `bug fixes`, `general
improvements` and `backward incompatible changes` you'll want to be aware of
when upgrading from tsurud 0.13.x or older versions.

Main new features
=================

* API versioning

* Deploy apps using Dockerfile or Docker image (`#1314
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1314>`_).
  Now it's possible to deploy a docker image as tsuru app using `tsuru
  app-deploy -i` command.  This image should be in a registry and be accessable
  by tsuru api. Image should also have a Entrypoint or a Procfile at given paths,
  `/` or `/app/user/` or `/home/application/current`.  See more in `tsuru-client
  app-deploy reference
  <https://tsuru-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#deploy>`_.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fix image remove from docker registry v2 (`#1361
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1361>`_).

General improvements
====================

* `projectid` parameter is not mandatory in `Apache CloudStack
  <https://cloudstack.apache.org/>`_ (`#1260
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1260>`_).
* A new app description field, that can be used to describe the app objective
  (`#1327 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1327>`_).
* New `SAML V2` authentication scheme. See :ref:`SAML authentication configuration <saml_configuration>`
  for instructions on how to configure it.
