tsurud 1.0.0 release notes
==========================

Welcome to tsurud 1.0.0!

These release notes cover the `new features`, `bug fixes`, `general
improvements` and `backward incompatible changes` you'll want to be aware of
when upgrading from tsurud 0.13.x or older versions.

Main new features
=================

* API versioning

* Deploy apps using Docker image (`#1314 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1314>`_).
  Now it's possible to deploy a Docker image as tsuru app using `tsuru
  app-deploy -i` command.  This image should be in a registry and be accessible
  by tsuru api. Image should also have a Entrypoint or a Procfile at given paths,
  `/` or `/app/user/` or `/home/application/current`.  See more in `tsuru-client
  app-deploy reference <https://tsuru-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#deploy>`_.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fix image remove from docker registry v2 (`#1361 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1361>`_).

General improvements
====================

* `projectid` parameter is not mandatory in `Apache CloudStack
  <https://cloudstack.apache.org/>`_ (`#1260 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1260>`_).

* A new app description field, that can be used to describe the app objective
  (`#1327 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1327>`_).

* New `SAML V2` authentication scheme. See :ref:`SAML authentication configuration <saml_configuration>`
  for instructions on how to configure it.

* Add new filters in the user list API endpoint: now it's possible to filter
  users by role and e-mail (issue `#1349 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1349>`_).

* Change user list filtering behavior. Consider users with permissions:

  A: app.create(team team1), app.create(team team2)
  B: app.create(team team1)

  The previous behavior was such as if user A called user-list they would
  see both users A and B. However user B calling user-list would only see
  themselves.

  Now user B will be able to see user A on user-list but only
  app.create(team team1) permission will show up.
