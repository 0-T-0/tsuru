tsr 0.8.0 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.8.0!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, `bug fixes`_, `backward
incompatible changes`_ and `general improvements`_ you'll want to be aware of
when upgrading from tsr 0.7.0 or older versions.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.8.0`_
.. _`general improvements`: `Other improvements in tsr 0.8.0`_

What's new in tsr 0.8.0
=======================

* tsuru now supports associating apps to plans which define how it can use machine
  resources, see `backward incompatible changes`_ for more information about which
  settings are no longer used with plans available, and how to use them.
* When using segregate scheduler, it's now possible to set a limit on how much
  memory of a memory will be reserved for app units. This can be done by defining
  some new config options. See the :ref:`config reference
  <config_scheduler_memory>` for more details.
* The behavior of ``restart``, ``env-set`` and ``env-unset`` has changed. Now
  they'll log their progress as they go through the following steps:

  - add new units;
  - wait for the health check if any is defined in tsuru.yaml;
  - add routes to new units;
  - remove routes from old units;
  - remove old units.


Bug fixes
=========

- docker-pool-teams-add: fix to don't allow duplicate teams in a pool (issue `#926
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/926>`_).

Other improvements in tsr 0.8.0

Backward incompatible changes
=============================

The following config settings have been deprecated:

* docker:allow-memory-set
* docker:max-allowed-memory
* docker:max-allowed-swap
