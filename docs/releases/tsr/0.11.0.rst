Welcome to tsr 0.11.0!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, `bug fixes`_, `backward
incompatible changes`_ (specially the requirement on Gandalf and Docker
versions), `general improvements`_ and `changes in the API`_ you'll want to be
aware of when upgrading from tsr 0.10.2 or older versions.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.11.0`_
.. _`general improvements`: `Other improvements in tsr 0.11.0`_
.. _`changes in the API`: `API changes`_

What's new in tsr 0.11.0
========================

* Now you can choose what pool to deploy your app. We add a ``-o [pool_name]``
  flag in ``tsuru app-create`` and it's required if you have more than one pool
  associated with your team.

  We add a new command ``tsuur pool-list``. Running it you will see all pools
  you have access and the teams associated with it.


Bug fixes
=========


Other improvements in tsr 0.11.0
================================


Backward incompatible changes
=============================

* We change the way tsuru uses scheduler's pool. So in this version you need to
  migrate your database to the new schema. To do that just run ``tsr migrate``
  and see if everything returns OK.


API changes
===========
