API changes
===========

For more details on the API, please refer to the :doc:`tsuru API documentation
</reference/api>`.

* ``/users/keys``: in previous versions of the API, this endpoint was used for
  adding and removing keys from the user account. Now it also lists the keys
  registered in the account of the user. Here is a summary of the behavior of
  this endpoint:

    - ``GET``: return the list of keys registered in the user account
    - ``POST``: add a new SSH key to the user account
    - ``DELETE``: remove a SSH key from the user account

  For the two last kind of requests, the user is now able to specify the name
  of the key, as well as the content.
