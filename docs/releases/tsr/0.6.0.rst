.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.6.0`_
.. _`general improvements`: `Other improvements`_

What's new in tsr 0.6.0
=======================

* Removed the ssh-agent dependency. Now tsuru will generate a RSA keypair per
  container, making it more secure and with one less agent running in the
  Docker hosts. Now a Docker host is just a host that runs Docker. tsuru server
  is still able to communicate with containers created using the ssh-agent, but
  won't create any new containers using a preconfigured SSH key. The version
  0.7.0 will delete ssh-agent completely.
* **under development** Improve handling of unit statuses. Now the unit will
  communicate with the server, minute after minute, updating the status. This
  will work as a heart beat. So the unit will change to the status "error"
  whenever the heart beat fails after 4 minutes or the unit informs that the
  process failed to install.

Bug fixes
=========

* fix security issue with user tokens: handlers that expected application token
  did not validate user access properly. With this failure, any authenticated
  user were able to add logs to an application, even if he/she doesn't have
  access to the app.

Breaking changes
================

* tsuru source no longer supports Go 1.1. It's possible that tsuru will build
  with Go 1.1, but it's no longer supported.

Other improvements
==================

* improve the structure of the documentation
* improve the search in the documentation
* cmd: properly handle multiline cells in tables
