.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.10.0`_
.. _`general improvements`: `Other improvements in tsr 0.10.0`_
.. _`changes in the API`: `API changes`_

What's new in tsr 0.10.0
========================

* Now ``tsuru app-run`` and ``tsuru-admin ssh`` use ``docker exec`` to run
  commands on containers, this means we don't run sshd inside the containers
  anymore, making the containers more lightweight and saving some machine
  resources.

  If you're running basebuilder platforms, it's recommended that you update your
  platforms **after** installing tsuru 0.10.0 using the "tsuru_0.10.0" (TODO!!!)
  branch. tsuru will remain working with older platforms but this will be dropped
  in the future.

* It's now possible to have multiple routers configurations in your tsuru.conf
  file. The configuration to be used will be defined by which plan the application
  is using. See :ref:`routers <config_routers>` configuration reference and
  `plan-create <http://tsuru-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#plan-create>`_ command for more details.

  For plans without a router configuration, the value defined in ``docker:router``
  will still be used. So nothing will break with this change. See
  :ref:`docker:router <config_docker_router>` for more information.


Bug fixes
=========

* Fix error message for unauthorized access in the ``team-user-add`` endpoint
  (issue `#1006 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1006>`_)
