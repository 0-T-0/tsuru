What's new in tsr 0.5.0
=======================

New commands:

* ssh (`#853 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/853>`_): using this
  command, tsuru administrators are able to connect directly to the cointainer
  via SSH. tsuru will generate an RSA keypair per container, and the server
  will use this keypair to communicate to the container via SSH. For more
  details, check the :ref:`reference for this command <tsuru_admin_ssh_cmd>`.
